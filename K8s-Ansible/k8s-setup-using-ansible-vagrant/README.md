# k8s-setup-using-ansible-vagrant
It's a copy from [kubernetes-setup-using-ansible-and-vagrant](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/15/kubernetes-setup-using-ansible-and-vagrant/) Kubernetes blog's post. I made some changes to update it.

```

┌─[torbite]@[Bio2059]:~/k8s-augusto/k8s-setup-using-ansible-vagrant
└──> $ vagrant status
Current machine states:

k8s-master                running (virtualbox)
node-1                    running (virtualbox)
node-2                    running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.

```
